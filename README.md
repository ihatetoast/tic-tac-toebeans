# Tic Tac Toebeans

## What

Tic-tac-toe / naughts and crosses game built with React using Vite. Players 1 and 2 start off with a default name, but a user has the option to change it. Turns are compared to


## Why

I've had "tic tac toebeans" stuck in my head for a long time, so I thought just getting the tic-tac-toe game with paws instead of naughts and crosses will help manage my senility.

## What About

Accessibility? Yes, this would not be a game for those with visual impairments. Ideally, there'd be some other ways to identify the player's symbol. The reason I am making this is for a reason to do the paws and toebeans via CSS. Attempting to solve the issue by using role="img" and aria-label="pink (or black) toe bean", etc.

# React + Vite Mumbo Jumbo

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
