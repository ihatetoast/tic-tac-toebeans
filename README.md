# Tic Tac Toebeans

## What

Tic-tac-toe / naughts and crosses game built with React using Vite. Players 1 and 2 start off with a default name, but a user has the option to change it. In lieu of naughts and crosses, a pure-css cat's paw with back toe beans appears as black (X) or pink (O). 

A log at the bottom adds some commentary.

## Why

I've had "tic tac toebeans" stuck in my head for a long time, so I thought just getting the tic-tac-toe game with paws instead of naughts and crosses will help manage my senility. 

I also wanted to play with pure css images in an app and not just on Codepen. This is styled mobile first, so it was also a practice styling mobile first (it's too easy to forget that while building an app).

## What About

Accessibility? Yes, this would not be a game for those with visual impairments. Ideally, there'd be some other ways to identify the player's symbol. The reason I am making this is for a reason to do the paws and toebeans via CSS. Attempting to solve the issue by using role="img" and aria-label="pink (or black) toe bean", etc.
